  One hour to madness and joy! O furious! O confine me not!
  (What is this that frees me so in storms?
  What do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean?)
  O to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man!
  O savage and tender achings! (I bequeath them to you my children,
  I tell them to you, for reasons, O bridegroom and bride.)

  O to be yielded to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me
      in defiance of the world!
  O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!
  O to draw you to me, to plant on you for the first time the lips of
      a determin'd man.

  O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep and dark pool, all
      untied and illumin'd!
  O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last!
  To be absolv'd from previous ties and conventions, I from mine and
      you from yours!
  To find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of Nature!
  To have the gag remov'd from one's mouth!
  To have the feeling to-day or any day I am sufficient as I am.

  O something unprov'd! something in a trance!
  To escape utterly from others' anchors and holds!
  To drive free! to love free! to dash reckless and dangerous!
  To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!
  To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!
  To rise thither with my inebriate soul!
  To be lost if it must be so!
  To feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom!
  With one brief hour of madness and joy.

<h2>Some of the Yellow Wallpaper</h2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of fate!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is a physician, and <I>perhaps</I>--(I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind)--<I>perhaps</I> that is one reason I do not get well faster.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see he does not believe I am sick!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can one do?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency-- what is one to do?<br>


<h2>A section of a Steve Yegge blog post on blogspot</h2>

<h3>Wait, dude, hang on -- I played Borderlands. It was OK, but nothing to go
    cryin' to Mom about</h3>
Well, no. No, you didn't really play Borderlands. What you played was more like
a teaser demo. If you made it through the main storyline and killed the huge
vaginalien (complete with Japanese-style tentacles) in the comically misnamed
"Vault", but <em>then you put the game away</em> -- well, my friend, I'm sad to
tell you that you missed out. All you got was the merest sniff of what the game
had in store. And it smelled like... well, the ending was a little fishy, if you
catch my drift.
<br/>
<br/>
See, you have to play the whole thing all the way through _twice_. Not with
different characters, either. You have to play the <em>same exact character</em>,
with all the loot and skills you built up on the first run-through. The second
time around, the enemies will sort-of kind-of be leveled to you except not
really. Not yet anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
OK then, what about after you finish it the second time? Ha! Still not done.
Yes, it's true that you now have more than a sniff -- you're up to a taste.
MMmmmm. But THEN you have to purchase at least two of the DLCs -- Knoxx for
sure, and arguably Moxxi just for the bank -- and play those too. Now you're
getting close to, uh, penetrating the secrets of Borderlands. (This appalling
metaphor is 100% Gearbox's fault. I accept no responsibility.)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, after all that -- in order to <em>truly</em> appreciate the greatness
of Borderlands -- you have to stumble across not one, but TWO bugs in the game.
Bugs without which everyone on earth would have basically forgotten the game by
now, and it'd be a lovely historical footnote like BioShock or Fallout 3. A game
to be played, sure, maybe a couple of times even, but shelved in the end. As
opposed to the situation we have today, which is thousands of people playing it
on- and offline around the clock, almost 4 years after the release.
<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't experience the end-game, then you didn't really play Borderlands.
