# SavePublishing.com

This is the code necessary for a full deploy of SavePublishing.com.

The code is written in CoffeeScript, with the exception of the bookmarklet itself, which is just JavaScript with a javascript: prefix.

The coffeescript source is in 
https://github.com/ftrain/savepublishing/tree/master/htdocs/coffee

- This is all a hot mess right now.
- There's very little testing, just a reloadable page with text samples.
- The docs are a mess.
- Etc., etc.

Involved folks are welcome to fork away. I'll try to keep a good branch live at savepublishing.com.
