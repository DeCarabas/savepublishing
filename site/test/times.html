A few weeks ago I&rsquo;d have told you that on the subject of equal rights for gays and lesbians &mdash; arguably the civil rights issue of our day &mdash; I was feeling pretty proud of my country. Gay equality is supported by swelling majorities in polls, especially among young Americans. We had an election in which, for the first time, voters in four states embraced equal marriage rights (which, let&rsquo;s be honest, is a proxy for equal citizenship). We have a <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/us/politics/obama-says-same-sex-marriage-should-be-legal.html?pagewanted=all">president who says</a> that families with homosexual parents are entitled to the same legal status and dignity as his own. I had a heartening sense of things turning right side up.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But a few conversations during my wanderings in South Africa have shaken my sense of satisfaction and made me rethink my standard of progress. Follow along, and see if you agree.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The very week the U.S. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/us/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-two-cases-on-gay-marriage.html">Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases</a> that may help resolve America&rsquo;s legal ambivalence on the subject of same-sex marriage, I paid a visit to the South African <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> to have lunch with Edwin Cameron. Justice Cameron is the most prominent openly gay official in South Africa, perhaps in all of Africa. He joined the court three years after the former anti-apartheid crusader Justice Albie Sachs wrote the eloquent (and unanimous) <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/19.html">2005 opinion</a> establishing the right of all South African gays and lesbians to marry. At the time only one American state, Massachusetts, allowed same-sex couples to marry.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The Constitutional Court works in a modern, light-flooded, hilltop building that is a shrine to the humanity and transparency of law. It is built on the site of, and incorporates the ruins of, holding cells where the likes of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi were confined. The Sachs opinion on gay marriage is just one reason the place is, literally, a moral high ground.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Edwin Cameron knows perfectly well that this can be a brutal continent for homosexuals. Most of South Africa&rsquo;s neighbors criminalize same-sex love. In Sudan, Mauritania and northern Nigeria, homosexuality is punishable by death, and Uganda &mdash; egged on by a tiny sect of American evangelicals &mdash; is considering joining the list. South Africa&rsquo;s own long historical tributaries of violence and misogyny have run together in a spate of gang rapes of lesbians. South Africa&rsquo;s president, Jacob Zuma, has at least twice voiced or abided antigay slurs during public appearances, afterward issuing what seemed to me less than heartfelt apologies.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Justice Cameron knows all of this, but he is by his own admission a man of &ldquo;sunny-side up&rdquo; temperament, and someone who sees constructive virtue in a positive approach. He predicts that the antigay backlash in Africa will in time produce the antidote to hatred, which is awareness. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean that there won&rsquo;t be two more decades of violence and oppression and killing,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;But I think the underlying problem, which is that we are not visible, I think that has changed. And I think that is almost as significant as what&rsquo;s happening in America.&rdquo;        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Rather than dwell on the offensive remarks of President Zuma, Cameron prefers to note that the climate in the country is sufficiently tolerant that Zuma felt obliged to apologize. (&ldquo;Edwin,&rdquo; a friend of the justice explained later, &ldquo;has a tactic: If I praise the homophobe, it will put pressure on the homophobe to live up to my praise. And sometimes it works.&rdquo;)        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
A few days later I had coffee with Eusebius McKaiser, a provocative young writer and radio talk-show host. His book of essays, &ldquo;A Bantu in My Bathroom,&rdquo; includes a sweet account of coming out as gay to his father, and the most persuasive argument you are likely to read in favor of polygamy. McKaiser is a friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cameron&rsquo;s, but is less encumbered by judiciousness. Our conversation about gay rights in Africa wended its way to a dilemma I&rsquo;ll put this way:        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
In South Africa, where popular opinion is hostile, the law stands firm and unequivocal. Moreover, doing the right thing in spite of the popular consensus is not only an act of moral courage; it turns out to be good politics, because the law is gradually and imperfectly enlarging the zone of tolerance. Gays are no longer invisible, and hostility toward gays has become &mdash; in the best sense &mdash; politically incorrect.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Yet in the United States, where public opinion is more mature &mdash; not universally so, as many bullied victims can testify, but more socially hospitable to gays than in South Africa &mdash; our law and our politics at the highest level verge on cowardice.        </p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Is that putting it too strongly? I don&rsquo;t think so. How else to describe a judiciary that apportions basic rights by putting its finger in the wind? It is a bit glib to say that the Supreme Court follows the polls, but on the subject of gay rights the court has done pretty much that. The obvious case in point is the legal status of gay sex itself. In 1986 our Supreme Court upheld Georgia&rsquo;s statute making sodomy a crime. It took 17 years, until most of the offensive state statutes had been withdrawn, for the Supreme Court to reverse itself. Equal rights were only equal rights when enough states said so. The current cases on gay marriage offer the Supreme Court a similar opportunity to split the difference between equality and bigotry, by leaving the matter of marriage to the states.        </p>
