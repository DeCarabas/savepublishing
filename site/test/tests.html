<h2>A section of a Steve Yegge blog post on blogspot</h2>

<h3>Wait, dude, hang on -- I played Borderlands. It was OK, but nothing to go
    cryin' to Mom about</h3>
Well, no. No, you didn't really play Borderlands. What you played was more like
a teaser demo. If you made it through the main storyline and killed the huge
vaginalien (complete with Japanese-style tentacles) in the comically misnamed
"Vault", but <em>then you put the game away</em> -- well, my friend, I'm sad to
tell you that you missed out. All you got was the merest sniff of what the game
had in store. And it smelled like... well, the ending was a little fishy, if you
catch my drift.
<br/>
<br/>
See, you have to play the whole thing all the way through _twice_. Not with
different characters, either. You have to play the <em>same exact character</em>,
with all the loot and skills you built up on the first run-through. The second
time around, the enemies will sort-of kind-of be leveled to you except not
really. Not yet anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
OK then, what about after you finish it the second time? Ha! Still not done.
Yes, it's true that you now have more than a sniff -- you're up to a taste.
MMmmmm. But THEN you have to purchase at least two of the DLCs -- Knoxx for
sure, and arguably Moxxi just for the bank -- and play those too. Now you're
getting close to, uh, penetrating the secrets of Borderlands. (This appalling
metaphor is 100% Gearbox's fault. I accept no responsibility.)
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, after all that -- in order to <em>truly</em> appreciate the greatness
of Borderlands -- you have to stumble across not one, but TWO bugs in the game.
Bugs without which everyone on earth would have basically forgotten the game by
now, and it'd be a lovely historical footnote like BioShock or Fallout 3. A game
to be played, sure, maybe a couple of times even, but shelved in the end. As
opposed to the situation we have today, which is thousands of people playing it
on- and offline around the clock, almost 4 years after the release.
<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't experience the end-game, then you didn't really play Borderlands.
