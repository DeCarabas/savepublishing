<p>Whales approach the city’s shores on occasion, and it rarely ends well. In 2007, a small minke whale appeared near the mouth of the Gowanus Canal but soon died. Robert DiGiovanni Jr., the Riverhead Foundation’s executive director, said that big whales struck by ships sometimes turn up in the harbor, but “it’s unusual” to see a whale the size of a finback come ashore. In 1964, when a 52-foot finback corpse turned up in the Hudson off 79th Street, The Times wrote that “seafaring folk along the river say they had never heard of whales, dead or alive, in those waters.”</p>

<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in
    General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for
    the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the
    good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these
    United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;
    that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that
    all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and
    ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they
    have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish
    Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may
    of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance
    on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
    Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
