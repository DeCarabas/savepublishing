<h2>Section from ProPublica that has linebreaks</h2>

            <p><em>This story
            was <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/02/can_you_fight_poverty_with_a_five_star_hotel">co-published
            with Foreign Policy</a>.</em></p>

<p>Accra is a city of choking red dust where almost
no rain falls for three months at a time and clothes hung out on a line dry in
15 minutes. So the new five-star M&#246;venpick hotel affords a haven of sorts
in Ghana&#8217;s crowded capital, with manicured lawns, amply watered vegetation, and
uniformed waiters gliding poolside on roller skates to offer icy drinks to
guests. A high concrete wall rings the grounds, keeping out the city&#8217;s
overflowing poor who hawk goods in the street by day and the homeless who lie
on the sidewalks by night. </p>
